It's a quiz app made for the sole purpose of learning.
It's contains a 5 min, 20 question quiz.
1 mark is allocated for right answer, there is no negative marking for wrong answer.
You can either submit it before time or it auto submits also once the time is over.
The questions are repetitive as it's hardcoded in json and can be easily replaced.
My main focus while developing the app was to make it as user friendly as possible.
I have uploaded the code , please feel free to download and explore.
In case of any queries , please do let me know. Thank you.
